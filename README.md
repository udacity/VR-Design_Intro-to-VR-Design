### Directory Structure
- The Unity project is the child directory of the repository and named according to the associated lesson.
- The Unity project is 'cleaned' and includes the `Assets` folder, the `ProjectSettings` folder, and the `UnityPackageManager` folder.


### Unity Project Settings
- The project's `Player Settings` and `Quality Settings` are set to default values for the Unity version used.

>**Important!** When deploying to device, make sure you configure the `Player Settings` for the target platform according to what you learned in the previous courses.

>**Note:** When deploying to device, it is recommended to update the `Quality Settings` according to what you learned in the previous courses.


### Unity Lighting Settings
- The scene's `Lighting Settings` are set to default values for the Unity version used.

>**Note:** When deploying to device, it is recommended to update the `Lighting Settings` as well as optimize the scene according to what you learned in the previous courses.


### GVR SDK for Unity
- `GoogleVR` > `Demos` is not included.
- `GoogleVR` > `GVRVideoPlayer.unitypackage` is not included.
- Scripts applicable to the course have been updated to reflect Unity's API change from `UnityEngine.VR` to `UnityEngine.XR`.
